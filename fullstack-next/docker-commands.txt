docker build -t cscphilip/brilliantwear-fullstack-next:latest .

# Then:
docker run -p 3000:3000 --mount type=bind,source=/home/ubuntu/brilliantwear/backend/images,target=/app/product-images/images -d --name brilliantwear-fullstack-next cscphilip/brilliantwear-fullstack-next:latest

# Take note of the bind mount in the above command that is for accessing the product images on the host.


# NOTE: It seems (after pretty good testing) that Next.js applications can't be run in docker swarm mode.
