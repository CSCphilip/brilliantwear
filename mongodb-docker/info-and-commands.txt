# To start a docker MongoDB as a service by using a docker compose file and starting a stack. It uses a bind mount to preserve the data when the service is closed. This will set up authentication by using a docker secret. It connects to an already existing docker network 'mongo-network'. Other docker services which want to access the MongoDB on docker also needs to be connected to this network.
docker stack deploy -c compose.yml bw-mongo


# Two ways to connect and authenticate:
mongosh localhost:5000 --authenticationDatabase "admin" -u "philip" -p
# You will be prompted to enter password.

# OR:

mongosh localhost:5000
# In mongosh:
use admin
db.auth("philip", passwordPrompt())
# Enter password when prompted. 


# You can connect to the MongoDB in docker container from the AWS EC2 by using the following command:
mongosh localhost:5000
