# To start a docker MongoDB as a service by using a docker compose file and starting a stack. It uses a bind mount to preserve the data when the service is closed. This will set up authentication by using a docker secret. It connects to an already existing docker network 'mongo-network'. Other docker services which want to access the MongoDB on docker also needs to be connected to this network, or connect to it through the host. This command will also start the mongo-backup service which backups the data every week (7 days) and saves it to /var/backups/mongodb.
docker stack deploy -c compose.yml bw-mongo


# Two ways to connect and authenticate. NOTE: this is not possible anymore (with the mongo service running in docker) since the port opening to the host has been removed to make the database more secure.
mongosh --authenticationDatabase "admin" -u "philip" -p

# You will be prompted to enter password.

# OR:

mongosh

# And then in mongosh:
use admin
db.auth("philip", passwordPrompt())

# Enter password when prompted. 


# Mongo import command:
mongoimport mongodb://localhost:27017/brilliantwear users.json --authenticationDatabase "admin" -u "philip" -p <password>


# To restore a mongodb from a .gz file. NOTE: the nsFrom and nsTo are not necessary and will only change the name of the db in mongodb.
